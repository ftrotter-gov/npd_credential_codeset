-- This table is hosted from https://github.com/ftrotter-gov/npd_credential_codeset
-- Which is a project to create a clinical credentials data set by miining the 
-- raw credentials that are found in NPPES

-- Column explinations: 
-- *  id - should be left alone, these were manually created to leave space between sections of the file
-- *  credential_abbr - the credential abbreviation should already be set
-- *  credential_name - the name of the credential spellout out, like "Medical Doctor" for M.D. and "Registered Nurse" for RN
-- *  credentialing_organization_name - not every organization has a single source, but when it does list it here.
-- *  credentialing_organization_url - the best url for that credential. Sometimes the best that can be gotten is the link to the credentialing organization home page.
-- *  credential_description - a natural language of the credential and its purpose.
-- *  is_multisource - lots of schools will grant an M.D. or an RN. These are multi-source credentials.
-- *  is_clinical - there are plenty of credentials, like CPA or CEO that have nothing to do with clinical practice. For the purposes of the database, we consider Veterinarian as non-clinical.
-- *  is_board_certification - should this credential be considered "board certified"
-- *  is_credential_retired - sometimes a credentialling organization will stop issuing a credential to new clinicians, but allow previous credential holders to continue using the credential.
-- *  created_at - should always be NULL so that the database can set
-- *  updated_at - should always be NULL so that the database can set.
