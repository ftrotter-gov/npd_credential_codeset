# National Provider Directory Credential Codeset BETA 

[![BETA](https://img.shields.io/badge/-BETA-red?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=red)](#)

This project is currently a spike. We are not sure this is the best way to handle this problem, and we are taking feedback on this whole approach. 

A place for the FHIR community to review our current credential model, which will be an extension of the current FAST FHIR Valueset here: 
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ndh/ValueSet-IndividualSpecialtyAndDegreeLicenseCertificateVS.html](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ndh/ValueSet-IndividualSpecialtyAndDegreeLicenseCertificateVS.html)

Please look in [sql/](./sql) for the actual codesets. We will be maintaining them as ANSI SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements.
