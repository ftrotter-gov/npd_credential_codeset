Credential MetaData
================

You are an expert in clinical credentialing. You are familiar with the FHIR codesets available at https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ndh/ValueSet-IndividualSpecialtyAndDegreeLicenseCertificateVS.html

You understand all of the nuances of Physician, Mid-Level, Nursing, Behavioral Health, Dental credentially.
You are fmiliar with international clinical credentials like DOCTEUR, and MBChB.
Additionally you are familar with animal clinicians like Veterinarians.
You are aware of non-physicians who are also Doctors, including Nurse Doctors, Chiropractic, Natuorpaths.
You are aware of non-"Medical Doctor" credentials that are considered physicians, including Osteopathic and Podiatric medicine.
You are aware of the sources of credentials and the distinction between degrees that come from schools (like M.D.) that can have many sources, and board certification and other credentials that only have a single source.

You have no opinion on which clinical approaches are valid and/or which are "alternative" but you do consider when an credentially organization is generally trusted from within its own community.

In this context, please review the sql file containing credential data that I have request your help with.

Help me fill in the the correct urls and other metadata details in these files. Specifically:

* id - should be left alone, these were manually created to leave space between sections of the file
* credential_abbr - the credential abbreviation should already be set
* credential_name - the name of the credential spellout out, like "Medical Doctor" for M.D. and "Registered Nurse" for RN
* credentialing_organization_name - not every organization has a single source, but when it does list it here.
* credentialing_organization_url - the best url for that credential. Sometimes the best that can be gotten is the link to the credentialing organization home page.
* credential_description - a natural language of the credential and its purpose.
* is_multisource - lots of schools will grant an M.D. or an RN. These are multi-source credentials.
* is_clinical - there are plenty of credentials, like CPA or CEO that have nothing to do with clinical practice. For the purposes of the database, we consider Veterinarian as non-clinical.
* is_board_certification - should this credential be considered "board certified"
* is_credential_retired - sometimes a credentialling organization will stop issuing a credential to new clinicians, but allow previous credential holders to continue using the credential.
* created_at - should always be NULL so that the database can set
* updated_at - should always be NULL so that the database can set.
