AI Usage
=======================

* Unless otherwise noted in specific files, the AI used to generate source code was Claude or Gemini, using the Cline extension to Visual Studio Code. These are the only things that are reading the AI_Instructions and implementing them.
* In some cases initial code will be generated using ChatGPT 5 or later. Very often the transcription feature of ChatGPT 5 is used to transcribe and then cleanup the specification that are listed in AI_Instructions
