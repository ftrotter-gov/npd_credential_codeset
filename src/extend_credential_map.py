ETL Pipeline Step: Extend Credential Mapping

This script extends the credential mapping by:
1. Automatically finding new mappings using LIKE pattern matching on existing credential abbreviations
2. Identifying unmapped credential texts that need manual review
3. Creating a prioritized table of unmapped entries for iterative processing

Designed to be run repeatedly as part of an iterative mapping workflow.
